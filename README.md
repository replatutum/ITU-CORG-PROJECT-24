# ITU Computer Organization Projects
## ALU System & CPU Design using Verilog
### Overview
This repository contains two projects for the Computer Organization course at ITU:

### Project 1: ALU System
- Implements basic operations: addition, subtraction, bitwise AND, OR, XOR, etc.
- Designed using structural Verilog.
- Includes testbenches for functional verification.

### Project 2: CPU
- Implements a basic processor with instruction fetching, decoding, execution, and memory access.
- Features a simple control unit and data path.
- Supports a small instruction set.
